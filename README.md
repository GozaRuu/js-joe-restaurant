# Js-Joe's Restaurant
Js Joe (you guessed it!) like his restaurant app 100% JavaScript.

This is a React, Redux, Reactstrap, React Native, Node JS, Express JS, Passport JS, MongoDB, Mongoose Fullstack application that explores the 100% JavaScript MERN stack potential.

It's made purely for an educational and a long-term technology demoing/testing purpose. It's heavily commented and based on widely used patterns from their respective communities.

A Glitch Remix will be added soon.
